* card0.py
    - Single player vs. dealer
* card1.py
    - multiplayers vs dealer with if-elif-else to determine winner
* card3.py
    - buildDecisionTable() function to determine the winner
* card4.py
    - use external decision table to make decision of who is the winner

# loop through all the values depending on how many players
# If player blows up first the dealer will win
# win = []
# for i in 29:
#   for d in 29:
#       win.append (i,d)
#       if i > d:
#           win.append (" :Player Wins")
#       else:
#           win.append (" :Dealer Wins")
#       win.append(, )
