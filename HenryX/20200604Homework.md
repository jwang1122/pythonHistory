### Terminal Vs. File
> Terminal is easier to write code because the File needs more code. For example, if you want to do a = 4 and type a and enter, the terminal will show 4, but in the file, you have to type print() before it.
### What is Print?
> When you type print() with something in quotation in the parenthesis and run it in the teminal, if will display the things you typed in the quotation mark. If you do two or more quotations with commas, it won't show the commas.

> If you put a sep=' ' with something inside, like a ; it will separate the quotations with a ;. 

> If you put a end='\n', the line will end and anything after will go on to the next line.
