# 2020-06-03 Homework-2

Please find attached pdf file in this folder named "12023 Harmoney School Houston.pdf" which is a math worksheet. Usually student will do all the math by themselves. In this homework, we ask students use what you have learned in the python class, the print statement, include all different formats, try your best to do as much as you can for the problems 1 through 80. As all you know, you may not be able to do so, that's absolutely fine. The goal for this homework is let everyone of you have feeling about how tedious these coding are. Once you have that feeling, you are ok. We will find better way to do these work in python in future class. But there are some of the problem can tell you how computer program do the job which need you think a lot. for instance, throw the dices.

Hope you enjoy the tedious work, no matter how many you can do, that's not the purpose. I'll see the more you can do, the more will learn, trust me.

Enjoy!
