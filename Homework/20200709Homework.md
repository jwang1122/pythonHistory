# 2020-07-09 Python Level 2 Homework

* Add more unittest code in test_card.py for all possible operations such as <, >, ==, + for both Card and BlackJackCard classes.
for example:
```py
    b1 = BlackJackCard("A","Diamonds")
    b2 = BlackJackCard("2", "Hearts")
    self.assertEqual(b2<b1, True)
```
* Modify card.py to allow test_deck.py pass all unit tests, especially the shuffle test.
    this test means, before shuffle the card, last card should be "K of Hearts", after shuffle, the card should be no longer "K".
    ```py
        def test_shuffle(self):
            deck = Deck()
            c1 = deck.nextCard()
            self.assertEqual(c1.face,"K")
            self.assertEqual(c1.suit,"Hearts")
            deck.shuffle()
            c1 = deck.nextCard()
            self.assertNotEqual(c1.face,"K")
    ```

* Modify card.py to allow test_player.py pass it's tests.
* Modify card.py to allow test_dealer.py pass it's tests.
