### Problem - didn't set up username and email
>Go to terminal

>From users\name\workspace\python\python1-0130
```sh
git config user.name "your name"
```
## Using print()

```sh
print("text", "other text," end = ' ' sep = ';')
```
The text and other text will be seperated by a semicolon and the last two terms will be seperated by a space

If the space between ' ' in sep is empty, they will be seperated by space

```sh
print("06. %d + %d = %d" % (a, b, c))
```

>%d is a placeholder, they will be replaced by the ones in the parentheses

```sh
print("11. Hello, {0}!".format(name))
```
>{0} is the placeholder this time, it will be replaced by the value in format()

```sh
print("20. pi is %4.3f" % pi)
```

>%4.3f means 4 digits and 3 decimal places, the result is ```pi is 3.142```

## Functions

```sh
def draw():
```
>def makes it a function, draw is the name

```sh
draw()
```
>That does the function

### Problem - no module named 'freegames'

>In terminal

>Make sure you are in Users\name\workspace\python

```sh
pip --version
```
>If you don't have pip, go to https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py

>Copy everything there, make a new .py file and paste it in

>If you already had pip or installed it, run:

```sh
pip install freegames
```
