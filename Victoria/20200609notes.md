% - remainder

```
for i in range(10):
    if (i % 2 == 1):
        print(i)

x = 100
if x == 0:
    print("x=0")
elif x % 2 == 1:
    print(x)
else:
    print(x)
```

= - sets variable equal to <value>

== - compares variable to see if equal or not 

starts with "if", if false, jumps to "elif", if false again, jumps to "else",
when a statement is true, it executes the command

It selects exactly one of the suites by evaluating the expressions one
by one until one is found to be true (see section Boolean operations
for the definition of true and false); then that suite is executed
(and no other part of the "if" statement is executed or evaluated).
If all expressions are false, the suite of the "else" clause, if
present, is executed.
