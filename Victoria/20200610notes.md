len - tells you how many total elements in a container, in builtins module
```
len(obj, /)
```
container - 

container name[element number order] - tell you specicfic element

the only difference between list and tuple is list uses [] and tuple uses ()

set uses {}, no duplicate elements in sets

to see if set contains an element:
```
<element> in <set name>
```

to add an element into a set:
```
s.add() 
```
