## refer to: tupleTest.py

to add two tuples:
```
t1 = (4, 6, 2, 8, 3, 1) 
print(t1)
t2 = (9,4,2)
t3 = t1 + t2
```
tuples are immutable, so you can not add new elements, but you can merge tuples, with the + operator you can add an element and it will create a new tuple, needs a comma when adding element:
```
t1 = t1 + (9,)
print(t1)
```

to add items in a specific index:
```
t1 = t1[:5] + (15, 20, 25) + t1[:5]
```

to convert the tuple to a list:
```
listx = list(t1) 
```

to add items in list:
```
listx.append(30)
```

to change element in list:
```
l[1] = "hello"
```

to change list to tuple:
```
t1 = tuple(listx)
```

to insert tuple at give position:
```
t1 = t1[:3] + (9,8,7) + t1[3:]
```

### dictionary

to add a definition:
```
d1 = {"k1":"v1","k2":"v2"}
d1["k3"] = "v3"
```

to change a definition:
```
d1["k2"] = 2
```

to delete a definition:
```
del d1["k2"]
```
or
```
v = d1.pop("k3")
```

## refer to: if-else.py

```
x = input("Please enter a integer number: ")
x = int(x)
```
converts string to integer


## refer to: guessNumber.py

random(module)

while loop: 
```
while <variable> == False/True:
    if:
    else:
```

## refer to: shapes.py

x - horizontal position on screen

y - vertical position on screen

up, down - lifts pen up/down

left, right - which direction pen faces

fd - moves pen forward

goto - position for pen to go to

draw a circle with radius r and position (x, y), starts drawing from bottom of circle:
```
def drawCircle(pen1, x, y, r):
```

rectangle:
```
def drawRectangle(pen1, x, y, width, height):
```

line:
```
def drawLine(pen1, x, y, angle, length):
```

triangle:
```
def drawTriangle(pen1, x, y, angle, side):
```

## refer to: testShapes.py

mainloop() - an infinite loop used to run the application, wait for an event to occur and process the event as long as the window is not closed

fill - fill with color
```
pen1.begin_fill()
```
```
pen1.end_fill()
```

width - thickness of line
```
pen1.width()
```

to choose color: 
```
Turtle(or whatever you named it).color('pen line color', 'fill color')
```
