.csv- comma separated values

This module provides classes that assist in the reading and writing
of Comma Separated Value (CSV) files, and implements the interface
described by PEP 305.  Although many CSV files are simple to parse,
the format is not formally defined by a stable specification and
is subtle enough that parsing lines of a CSV file with something
like line.split(",") is bound to fail.  The module supports three
basic APIs: reading, writing, and registration of dialects.

```
#,First name,Last name,Score
1423,John,Wang,94
```
list categories in order

## refer to: file0-5.py

to create a file and write a string in it:
```
file1 = open("hello.txt", "+w")
print("Hello, world!", file=file1)
file1.close()
```

function to read and write in a file:
```
def fileread(filaname):
    file1 = open(filaname)
    text = file1.read()
    file1.close()
    return text

def filewrite(filename, line):
    file1 = open(filename, 'a')
    file1.write(f"\nprint('{line}')")
    file1.close()
```

to read an existing file and add a new line in it:
```
print(fileread("circle.py"))
filewrite("circle.py", "Hello, world.")
```
the difference between open and with open is that with open will close the file automatically
```
with open("circle.py") as f:
```
```
file1 = open("circle.py")
```

.json - JavaScipt Object Notation

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) <http://json.org> is a subset of
JavaScript syntax (ECMA-262 3rd edition) used as a lightweight data
interchange format.

to write json object (dict) into json file:
```
import json

with open("./student.json", "+w") as f:
```

to load the content from the file:
```
with open("./student.json") as f:
```

pandas - a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data
structures designed to make working with "relational" or "labeled" data both
easy and intuitive.

to read and print a csv file:
```
import pandas as pd

students = pd.read_csv("students.csv")
print(students)
```

to plot data from a csv file:
```
import pandas as pd 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

data = pd.read_csv("students.csv")

x = data['First name']
y = data['Score']

plt.plot(x,y)
plt.show()
```
