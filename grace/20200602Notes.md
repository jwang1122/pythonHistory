>Click the yellow button that says "Download Python 3.8.3"

>Once python is downloaded, create a new folder "workspace" and then inside that folder create another called "python"

>Make sure that you can access python through the cmd window 
>>You can do this by opening the cmd window and typing: python --version 
>>It should print the version of python that you have installed and in my case it was: **Python 3.8.3**

## ***Install VSCode***

![Openfolder Download Image](openfolder.png)

>Open the python folder and then make a new file called: hello.py

**In that file, write the statement:**
```py
print("Hello, World!")
```
**Then run the code using the green play button on the top right. It should print:** *Hello, World!*

**You can also add and subtract in python by saying:** 
```py
print(1+2-4)
```
**Then run the code and it should print *-1* which is the correct answer to 1+2-4.** 

**You can also multiply and divide by saying:** 
```py
print(2*5)
print(28/7)
```
**Then run the code and it prints *10* and *4.0*, which are the correct answers to those problems**

cd: change directory
```sh
cd workspace
cd python
```
