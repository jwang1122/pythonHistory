## Clone the GitHub folder into Python
* Open your cmd window, then use the cd command and go to your python folder 

* Then type **git clone https://github.com/jwang1122/python1-0130.git** and click enter 

* Then type **cd python1-0130**

* then type **dir** and that shows you what is inside the file and you can make sure you have all the files  

## Push 
* Click on the third icon on the side 

* Then click the 3 dots and click 'Push' and it should move those files online 

## Problem One 
* Open the terminal and type **git config user.name "Grace Yang"** and return
* type **cd python1-0130 up arrow twice** and return 
* then type **got config user.email "gyang6633@gmail.com"**

## Create env folder 

* open terminal and type **python**
* then type **-m venv env**
* then type **.\env\Scripts\activate.bat**

## Coding in the terminal   

> Basic assignments
* type **a = 5** return 
* type **b = 6** return 
* type **a + b** return 
* it should give you **11**
* type **c = a + b** return 
* type **c** return 
* it should also give you **11** return

> Finding variable type 
* type **type(a)** and it should return **<class 'int'>** 
* change the variable by saying **a = 2.3**
* then type **type(a)** again and it should return **<class 'float'>** 

> List/Tuple Code
```
>>> l = [1,2,3,4]
>>> t = tuple(l)
>>> type(l)
<class 'list'>
>>> type(t)
<class 'tuple'>
>>> tuple = 3.4
>>> type(tuple)
<class 'float'>
>>> t = tuple(l)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: 'float' object is not callable
>>> t1 = (1,2,3,4)
>>> type(t1)
<class 'tuple'>
>>> t1 = (1,2,3,4,"hello")
>>> type(t1)
<class 'tuple'>
```
> help code 
```
>>> help()

Welcome to Python 3.8's help utility!

If this is your first time using Python, you should definitely check out
the tutorial on the Internet at https://docs.python.org/3.8/tutorial/.

## Too many files being changed 
* make a new file called gitignore 
* in the file type **env/**
