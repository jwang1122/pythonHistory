# 06/16/20 Notes by Grace Yang

## To fix China-vs-USA.py and chart-2.py
* get rid of ./data/
* also make sure to download the .csv file 

## Coded plots 0-3
* too much code to copy into here, refer to python folder  

## Math Operations 
* +, -, /, *, **, %
* floor division: // 

## Assignments 
* a += b is the same as a = a + b 
* can use min(a,b) to find minimum of the two numbers 

## Comparison Operators
* ==,!=,<,>,<=,>=

## went over meaning of ternary.py code 
```
"""
use ternary statement find minimum value of two numbers
"""

a, b = 10, 20
min0 = min(a, b)
print("07:", min0)

min1 = a if a < b else b
print("10:", min1)

print ("Both a and b are equal" if a == b else "a is greater than b" if a > b else "b is greater than a") 

if a != b: 
    if a > b: 
        print("a is greater than b")

        print("b is greater than a")

    print("Both a and b are equal") 

min1 = a<b and a or b
print("23:",min1)

# use tuple and test make decision
min2 = (b, a)[a < b]
print("27:", min2)

# use dict and test make decision
min2 = {True: a, False: b}[a < b]
print("31:", min2)

# min5 = (lambda: a, lambda: b)[a > b]()
# print("21:", min5)

min3 = min(34, 56, 74, 23)
print("37:", min3)

t = (3, 7, 2, 67)
print("40:", min(t))

l = [8, 4, 76, 45]
print("43:", min(l))


```
* can use min for tuple and lists
